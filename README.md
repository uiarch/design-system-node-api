### Was all this ^^ necessary?
  * No not entirely, but by documenting all of my dependencies I was able to remove about 50% of what I had installed and narrow it down by asking my self why I was using it and how important was it.

## Installation
---

* Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/uiarch/design-system-node-api.git`.
* Cd into app `cd design-system-node-api`.
* Run `npm install`.
* Follow [MongoDB Instructions below](#install-mongodb).
* Run `cp .example.env .env` and fill in values.
* Run `npm run build:dev` and then `npm run watch:dev` files will be compiled and ran from `www` dir.

    * `npm run contributors:add -- <github username> <contrib type>`
    * `npm run contributors:generate` generates contributors in readme.md.
* Uses [jest](https://jestjs.io/) library for testing.
  * To run test simply run.
    * `npm run test`.
